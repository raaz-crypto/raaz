-- | The class abstracts an arbitrary hash type. Minimum complete
-- definition include @padLength@, one of @`padding`@ or @`unsafePad`@
-- and @`maxAdditionalBlocks`@. However, for efficiency you might want
-- to define all of the members separately.
--
-- [Warning:] While defining the @'Eq'@ instance of @'Hash' h@, make
-- sure that the @==@ operator takes time independent of the input.
-- This is to avoid timing based side-channel attacks. In particular,
-- /do not/ take the lazy option of deriving the @'Eq'@ instance.

  -- | There are two reasons to pad the data to be hashed. The obvious
  -- reason is to handle messages that are not multiples of the block
  -- size. Howerver, there is a more subtle reason. For hashing
  -- schemes like Merkel-Damgård, the strength of the hash crucially
  -- depends on the padding. This combinator returns the length of the
  -- padding that is to be added to the message.

            -> BITS Word64 -- ^ the total message size in bits.
            -> BYTES Int

  -- | This function returns the actual bytestring to pad the message
  -- with. There is a default definition of this message in terms of
  -- the unsafePad function. However, implementations might want to
  -- give a more efficient definition.

  padding h bits = unsafeCreate len padIt
        where BYTES len = padLength h bits
              padIt     = unsafePad h bits . castPtr
  -- | This is the unsafe version of the padding function. It is
  -- unsafe in the sense that the call @unsafePad h bits cptr@ assumes
  -- that there is enough free space to put the padding string at the
  -- given pointer.
  unsafePad :: h -> BITS Word64 -> CryptoPtr -> IO ()
  unsafePad h bits = unsafeCopyToCryptoPtr $ padding h bits

  -- | This counts the number of additional blocks required so that
  -- one can hold the padding. This function is useful if you want to
  -- know the size to be allocated for your message buffers.
  maxAdditionalBlocks :: h -> BLOCKS h
  
  -- | The recommended number of blocks to hash at a time. While
  -- hashing files, bytestrings it makes sense to hash multiple blocks
  -- at a time. Setting this member appropriately (typically depends
  -- on the cache size of your machine) can drastically improve cache
  -- performance of your program. Default setting is @1@.

-- | Underlying a cryptographic hash, whether it is one of the
-- Merkel-Damgård hashes like SHA1 or HAIFA hashes like BLAKE, is a
-- compressor which works on a fixed block of bits. This compressor is
-- what does all the hardwork and the security of the hash depends on
-- the security of this function. We capture this compressor via the
-- type class HashImplementation.

class Hash h => HashImplementation i h where
  -- | Hash functions proceeds in rounds where each round processes
  -- one block. This assocaited type captures the intermediate value
  -- required in the processing of the next block. For Merkel-Damgård
  -- this is usually just h, although one could use a more efficient
  -- representation of it. In HAIFA hashes, it usually contains the
  -- salt and the number of bits processed as well.
