-- | A type whose only purpose in this universe is to provide
-- alignment safe pointers.
newtype CryptoAlign = CryptoAlign Word deriving Storable

-- the input of the other algorithm, for e.g RSA sign the HMAC of a
-- message.
class CryptoCoerce s t where
  cryptoCoerce :: s -> t


-- | This class is defined mainly to perform endian safe loading and
-- storing. For any type that might have to be encoded as either byte
-- strings or peeked/poked from a memory location it is advisable to
-- define an instance of this class. Using store and load will then
-- prevent endian confusion.
class Storable w => CryptoStore w where
  store :: CryptoPtr -> w -> IO ()

Developers notes:
-----------------

Make sure that the endian encoded version does not have any
performance penalty. We may have to stare at the core code generated
by ghc.

-- $endianSafe
--
-- One of the most common source of implementation problems in crypto
-- algorithms is the correct dealing of endianness. We define the
-- class `CryptoStore` to solve this problem in a type safe way. Any
-- type that might have to be encoded as either byte strings or
-- peeked/poked from a memory location should be an instance of this
-- class.
--
-- This module also provide explicitly endianness encoded versions of
-- Word32 and Word64 which are instances of `CryptoStore`. These types
-- inherit their parent type's `Num` instance (besides `Ord`, `Eq`
-- etc). The advantage is the following uniformity in their usage in
-- Haskell code:
--
--   1. Numeric constants are represented in their Haskell notation
--      (which is big endian). For example 0xF0 represents the number
--      240 whether it is `Word32LE` or `Word32BE` or just `Word32`.
--
--   2. The normal arithmetic work on them.
--
--   3. They have the same printed form except for the constructor
--      sticking around.
--
-- Therefore, as far as Haskell programmers are concerned, `Word32LE`
-- and `Word32BE` should be treated as `Word32` for all algorithmic
-- aspects. Similarly, `Word64LE` and `Word64BE` should be treated as
-- `Word64`. One can use the load/store functions to encode them
-- safely as well.

-- | Little endian `Word32`.
newtype Word32LE = LE32 Word32
   deriving ( Arbitrary, Bounded, Enum, Read, Show
            , Integral, Num, Real, Eq, Ord, Bits
            , Storable, Typeable
            )

-- | Big endian  `Word32`
newtype Word32BE = BE32 Word32
   deriving ( Arbitrary, Bounded, Enum, Read, Show
            , Integral, Num, Real, Eq, Ord, Bits
            , Storable, Typeable
            )

-- | Little endian `Word64`
newtype Word64LE = LE64 Word64
   deriving ( Arbitrary, Bounded, Enum, Read, Show
            , Integral, Num, Real, Eq, Ord, Bits
            , Storable, Typeable
            )

Developers notes:

The next set of conversion functions are intensionally not exported
and are defined only to aid readability of the Storable instance
declaration. At first glance it might appear that they could be useful
but their export can cause confusion.
