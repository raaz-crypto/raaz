-- | Module to write stuff to buffers. This writer provides low level
-- writing of data to memory locations given by pointers. It does the
-- necessary pointer arithmetic to make the pointer point to the next
-- location. No range checks are done to speed up the operations and
-- hence these operations are highly unsafe. Use it with care.
