# Add new packages here. The order of listing the packages is
# important as the packages are unregistered in the order given
# below. When in doubt arrange it in the reverse order of dependency,
# i.e if a package foo depends on bar then list foo before bar. In any
# case make sure that raaz-config is the last in this list.


# TODO: Can this ordering be auto generated from the depenency in the
# make file. Can it be generated using some cabal scripting.
