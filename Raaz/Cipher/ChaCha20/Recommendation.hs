-- | The chacha stream cipher is also used as the prg for generating
-- random bytes. Such a prg needs to keep an auxilary buffer type so
-- that one can generate random bytes not just of block size but
-- smaller. This memory type is essentially for maintaining such a
-- buffer.

newtype RandomBuf = RandomBuf { unBuf :: Pointer }



instance Memory RandomBuf where

  memoryAlloc     = RandomBuf <$> pointerAlloc sz
    where sz = atLeastAligned randomBufferSize randomBufferAlignment

  unsafeToPointer = unBuf

-- | Get the actual location where the data is to be stored. Ensures
-- that the pointer is aligned to the @randomBufferAlignment@
-- restriction.
getBufferPointer :: MT RandomBuf Pointer
getBufferPointer = actualPtr <$> getMemory
  where actualPtr = flip alignPtr randomBufferAlignment . unBuf


--------------------- DANGEROUS CODE --------------------------------

-- Things to take care in this module
-- ==================================
--
-- 1. ENSURE randomBufferSize IS THE MAXIMUM FOR ALL IMPLEMENTATIONS of
--    chacha20 random stream. OTHERWISE BUFFER OVERFLOW.
--
-- 2. Ensure that the alignment requirement is the maximum so that any
--    implementation can use the same memory.




-- | The size of the buffer in blocks of ChaCha20. While the
-- implementations should handle any multiple of blocks, often
-- implementations naturally handle some multiple of blocks, for
-- example the Vector256 implementation handles 2-chacha blocks. Set
-- this quantity to the maximum supported by all implementations.
randomBufferSize :: BLOCKS ChaCha20
randomBufferSize = 4  `blocksOf` ChaCha20

-- | Implementations are also designed to work with a specific
-- alignment boundary. Unaligned access can slow down the primitives
-- quite a bit. Set this to the maximum of alignment supported by all
-- implementations
randomBufferAlignment :: Alignment
randomBufferAlignment = 32 -- For 256-bit vector instructions.
