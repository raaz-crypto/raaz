-- $memorysubsystem$
--
-- Cryptographic operations often need to keep sensitive information
-- in its memory space. If this memory is swapped out to the disk,
-- this can be dangerous. The primary purpose of the memory subsystem
-- in raaz provides a way to allocate and manage _secure memory_,
-- i.e. memory that will not be swapped out during the execution of
-- the process and will be wiped clean after use. There are there
-- important parts to the memory subsystem:
--
-- [The `Memory` type class:] A memory element is some type that holds
-- an internal buffer inside it.
--
-- [The `Alloc` type:] Memory elements need to be allocated and this
-- is involves a lot of low lever pointer arithmetic. The `Alloc`
-- types gives a high level interface for memory allocation. For a
-- memory type `mem`, the type `Alloc mem` can be seen as the
-- _allocation strategy_ for mem. For example, one of the things that
-- it keeps track of the space required to create an memory element of
-- type `mem`. There is a natural applicative instance for `Alloc`
-- which helps build the allocation strategy for a compound memory
-- type from its components in a modular fashion _without_ explicit
-- size calculation or offset computation.
--
-- [The `MonadMemory` class:] Instances of these classes are actions
-- that use some kind of memory elements, i.e. instances of the class
-- `Memory`, inside it. Any such monad can either be run using the
-- combinator `securely` or the combinator `insecurely`. If one use
-- the combinator `securely`, then all allocations done during the run
-- is from a locked memory pool which is wiped clean before
-- de-allocation. The types `MT` and `MemoryM` are two instances that
-- we expose from this library.
--

-- $init-extract$
--
-- Memory elements often needs to be initialised. Similarly data needs
-- to be extracted out of memory. An instance declaration
-- @`Initialisable` mem a@ for the memory type @mem@ indicates that it
-- can be initialised with the pure value @a@. Similary, if values of
-- type @b@ can be extracted out of a memory element @mem@, we can
-- indicate it with an instance of @`Extractable` mem a@.
--
-- There is an inherent danger in initialising and extracting pure
-- values out of memory. Pure values are stored on the Haskell stack
-- and hence can be swapped out. Consider a memory element @mem@ that
-- stores some sensitive information, say for example the unencrypted
-- private key. Now suppose that we need to extracting out the key as
-- a pure value before its encryption and storage into the key file,
-- it is likely that the key is swapped out to the disk as part of the
-- haskell heap.
--
-- The `InitialiseFromBuffer` (`ExtractableToBuffer`) class gives an
-- interface for reading from (writing to) buffers directly minimising
-- the chances of inadvertent exposure of sensitive information from
-- the Haskell heap due to swapping.

-- | A class that captures monads that use an internal memory element.
--
-- Any instance of `MonadMemory` can be executed `securely` in which
-- case all allocations are performed from a locked pool of
-- memory. which at the end of the operation is also wiped clean
-- before deallocation.
--
-- Systems often put tight restriction on the amount of memory a
-- process can lock.  Therefore, secure memory is often to be used
-- judiciously. Instances of this class /should/ also implement the
-- the combinator `insecurely` which allocates all memory from an
-- unlocked memory pool.
--
-- This library exposes two instances of `MonadMemory`
--
-- 1. /Memory threads/ captured by the type `MT`, which are a sequence
-- of actions that use the same memory element and
--
-- 2. /Memory actions/ captured by the type `MemoryM`.
--
-- /WARNING:/ Be careful with `liftIO`.
--
-- The rule of thumb to follow is that the action being lifted should
-- itself never unlock any memory. In particular, the following code
-- is bad because the `securely` action unlocks some portion of the
-- memory after @foo@ is executed.
--
-- >
-- >  liftIO $ securely $ foo
-- >
--
-- On the other hand the following code is fine
--
-- >
-- > liftIO $ insecurely $ someMemoryAction
-- >
--
-- Whether an @IO@ action unlocks memory is difficult to keep track
-- of; for all you know, it might be a FFI call that does an
-- @memunlock@.
--
-- As to why this is dangerous, it has got to do with the fact that
-- @mlock@ and @munlock@ do not nest correctly. A single @munlock@ can
-- unlock multiple calls of @mlock@ on the same page.
--
class (Monad m, MonadIO m) => MonadMemory m where
  -- | Perform the memory action where all memory elements are allocated
  -- locked memory. All memory allocated will be locked and hence will
  -- never be swapped out by the operating system. It will also be wiped
  -- clean before releasing.
  --
  -- Memory locking is an expensive operation and usually there would be
  -- a limit to how much locked memory can be allocated. Nonetheless,
  -- actions that work with sensitive information like passwords should
  -- use this to run an memory action.
  securely   :: m a -> IO a


  -- | Perform the memory action where all memory elements are
  -- allocated unlocked memory. Use this function when you work with
  -- data that is not sensitive to security considerations (for example,
  -- when you want to verify checksums of files).
  insecurely :: m a -> IO a


-- | An action of type @`MT` mem a@ is an action that uses internally
-- a a single memory object of type @mem@ and returns a result of type
-- @a@. All the actions are performed on a single memory element and
-- hence the side effects persist. It is analogues to the @ST@
-- monad.
newtype MT mem a = MT { unMT :: mem -> IO a }

------------- Lifting pointer actions -----------------------------

-- | A pointer action inside a monad @m@ is some function that takes a
-- pointer action of type @Pointer -> m a@ and supplies it with an
-- appropriate pointer. In particular, memory allocators are pointer
-- actions.
type PointerAction m a b = (Pointer -> m a) -> m b

-- | An IO allocator can be lifted to the memory thread level as follows.
liftPointerAction :: PointerAction IO a b -> PointerAction (MT mem) a b
liftPointerAction allocator mtAction
  = execute $ \ mem -> allocator (\ ptr -> unMT (mtAction ptr) mem)

-- TODO: This is a very general pattern needs more exploration.

-- | The combinator @onSubMemory@ allows us to run a memory action on a
-- sub-memory element. Given a memory element of type @mem@ and a
-- sub-element of type @submem@ which can be obtained from the
-- compound memory element of type @mem@ using the projection @proj@,
-- then @onSubMemory proj@ lifts the a memory thread of the sub
-- element to the compound element.
--

---------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Any cryptographic primitives use memory to store stuff. This
-- class abstracts all types that hold some memory. Cryptographic
-- application often requires securing the memory from being swapped
-- out (think of memory used to store private keys or passwords). This
-- abstraction supports memory securing. If your platform supports
-- memory locking, then securing a memory will prevent the memory from
-- being swapped to the disk. Once secured the memory location is
-- overwritten by nonsense before being freed.
--
-- While some basic memory elements like `MemoryCell` are exposed from
-- the library, often we require compound memory objects built out of
-- simpler ones. The `Applicative` instance of the `Alloc` can be made
-- use of in such situation to simplify such instance declaration as
-- illustrated in the instance declaration for a pair of memory
-- elements.
