The internals of the memory subsystem. This module provides utility
functions to work with secure memory. By secure memory, we mean memory
that will /not/ be swapped out to the external disk. It is recommended
to use secure memory to store sensitive information like pass-phrase,
especially in an environment where there are hostile users on the same
system. However, using secure memory alone is not really going to save
the day.

Operating systems have limit on the amount of memory that can be
locked by a users process. So use it judiciously.

-- $architecture
--
-- We describe the architecture of the secure memory allocation
-- system. Memory is allocated as a `ForeignPtr` and finalizers are
-- set that will wipe the memory with zeros before de-allocation.  The
-- memory is allocated in units of pages as most operating systems
-- support only locking of an entire page. We call this a pool
-- captured by the data type `Pool`. During the course of allocation
-- this pool gets fragmented into blocks. Therefore, a pool is
-- essentially a list of blocks (captured by the `Block` data type)
-- together with some meta information. Finally we have the
-- `PoolRef` which keeps track fo all the pools in a `IORef`.
