version: 0.3.0

synopsis: The signature package for implementations of primitives in raaz.

description: This package is part of the raaz cryptographic library
  that abstracts out implementations of cryptographic primitives as a
  signature. To provide a new implementation of primitive, one builds
  a module that satisfy the signature given here. The standard
  implementaions are separately provided by the raaz-implementation
  package. Some of these implementations might use hardware specific
  features like (avx2 instructions in x86_64). This interface provides
  a way for down stream users to "plugin" the best interface depending
  on the hardware.
